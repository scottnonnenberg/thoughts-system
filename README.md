# thoughts-system

This is my [system for keeping track of thoughts and goals](https://blog.scottnonnenberg.com/resolutions-and-systems/). Local text files, tracked with git, and scripts to analyze/generate them (bash and node.js). All to support:

* journaling (or [morning pages](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/03/morning-pages-change-your-life-oliver-burkeman))
* daily logs of tasks and achievements (try using this as your 'home' page instead of your email inbox)
* weekly goals
* monthly and yearly reviews

## Getting Started

First, fork this repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:scottnonnenberg/thoughts-system.git .
```

Then set your `EDITOR` environment variable, by putting something like this into your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` (be sure to `source <filename>` for this terminal session if you make changes):

```bash
export EDITOR=subl
```

Now, start your first journal:

```bash
./journal.sh
```

You should see a nice, new journal file in your editor with the day of the week and start time at the top, generated to `YYYY/MM-MONTH/YYYYMMDD.txt`. Add some of your thoughts. You might consider installing a word count tool in your editor of choice. It is recommended that morning pages be about three pages, or about 750 words (thanks, [Buster](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonoberholtzer/2011/03/30/internet-transparency-a-chat-with-buster-benson/)).

Now you can start using some of the analysis tools. You'll need [`node.js`](http://nodejs.org/) installed to use them...

```bash
npm install

# how many days in a row of your journaled?
./streak

# what percentage of this year so far have you journaled?
./rateOfJournals
```

## Generation scripts:

* `log.sh` - generates a log file for today and opens it, or opens today's if it already exists
* `journal.sh` - generates a journal entry file for today an opens it, or opens today's if it already exists
* `week.sh` and `nextWeek.sh` - generates a weekly goals file and opens it, or generates a new one. If today is a monday, creates it for this week. If not, the weekly file for next week will be created.
* `month.sh` - generates a monthly review file for this month then opens it, or opens the existing file
* `year.sh` - generates a file for a yearly review, using monthly review as template

_Note: all of these support a date as the first parameter, in the form `2014-06-23`_

## Analysis scripts:
* `streak` - (supports `--help`) starting with today's journal, looks at every day, counting backwards, until it finds a day with no journal. Then it reports the number of days with journals.
* `rateOfJournals` - (supports `--help`) by default, calculates the percentage of journal entries so far this year.
* `thisDayInHistory` - (supports `--help`) with no arguments, lists all the journals on this day of the year, as far back as 1997.
* `emotions` - uses the [Regressive Imagery Dictionary](http://enjoymentland.com/2010/01/11/the-regressive-imagery-dictionary/) ([via `ridict` node module](https://github.com/frankamp/node-ridict)) to analyze today's journal entry. Or, you can provide a path to a file as the first argument.
* `markov` - generates a markov chain-based gibberish string based on today's journal entry ([via `markov` node module](https://github.com/substack/node-markov))
* `dayOfWeekInHistory` - (supports `--help`) fun little script that tells you the day of week in history for this date

## Other files:

* `commit.sh` - adds all changes in the repo and then commits it with the message 'autocommit for <date>'. I use this in a cron task to commit my changes every half-hour.
* `info` - I use this for all sort of reference information. It starts with the three templates: `day.txt`, `week.txt`, `month.txt`
* `src` - javascript source
* `package.json` - node.js dependency list
